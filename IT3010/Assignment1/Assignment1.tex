\section{Motivation}
From the very beginning of the modern healthcare information system the security has been considered an important issue. This because of the highly sensitive personal data that they contains, and it raises a consern around the guarantee of protection, confitentiality and integrity of patient information\cite{Smith199939}. In Norway today, the different institutions have their own healthcare systems to keep records due to that it does not exists a common system that is easy to use and secure enough.



%Agile software development methods\cite{cockburn2002agile}, such as eXtreme Programming\cite{beck2004extreme} (XP), have become very popular during the last decade, being used in many kinds of projects, and often with better success than some of the more traditional methods, such as the waterfall model\cite{Royce:1987:MDL:41765.41801}. Despite of this a literature review published in 2008\cite{Dyba2008833} found that even though they identified 1996 studies (of which 36 were found to be studies of acceptable rigor, credibility and relevance) there is a vast backlog of research issues to be addressed in this field. One such issue is that agile methods are difficult to use in projects with strong safety requirements\cite{turk2002limitations} due to,  among other things, the heavy documentation demands following from various safety standards. The purpose of this research proposal is therefore to investigate the possibilities for using agile methods to develop safety critical systems, with a focus on the analysis of safety hazards and specification of safety requirements.

\section{Relevant studies}

\section{Research questions and objectives}

From the previous information presented, this reasearch will look at the security issues in electronic patient records. It is a crucial study that can make it easier in the future to share patient records across private- and government own institutions and save lifes.
