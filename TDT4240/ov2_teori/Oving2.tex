\section{Introduction}
\emph{3.a) For the patterns listing in Step3, which are architectural patterns 
and which are design patterns? What are the relationships and differences of 
architectural patterns and design patterns?}
\\

\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | } \hline
  Observer & 2 Design Pattern \\ \hline
  State & Design Pattern \\ \hline
  Template Method & Design Pattern \\ \hline
  MVC & Architectural pattern \\ \hline
  Abstract Factory & Design Pattern \\ \hline
  Pipe and Filter & Deisgn Pattern \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\\

\emph{3.b) How is the pattern you chose realized in your code? (Which class(es)
 works as the pattern you chose?)}
\\
We chose to implement the MVC-pattern in our assignment. In our implementation, 
the Ball and Paddle-class works as the model, and the State works as the View- Controller. 
Whenever the controllers TouchListener recieves a TouchEvent and needs to move the sprite, itâ€™s call the 
setPosition-method of the appropriate Paddle-instance. To showcase a seperate View without controller attributes, we made a GameOverView for when the game is over.\\

\emph{3.c) Is there any advantages in using this pattern in this program? (What are the advan- tages/disadvantages?)}\\
An advantage of using the MVC-pattern is that the setLabel-method is only run at changes in the X- and Y-coordinates.
