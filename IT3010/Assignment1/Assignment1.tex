\section{Motivation}
%Agile software development methods\cite{cockburn2002agile}, such as eXtreme Programming\cite{beck2004extreme} (XP), have become very popular during the last decade, being used in many kinds of projects, and often with better success than some of the more traditional methods, such as the waterfall model\cite{Royce:1987:MDL:41765.41801}. Despite of this a literature review published in 2008\cite{Dyba2008833} found that even though they identified 1996 studies (of which 36 were found to be studies of acceptable rigor, credibility and relevance) there is a vast backlog of research issues to be addressed in this field. One such issue is that agile methods are difficult to use in projects with strong safety requirements\cite{turk2002limitations} due to,  among other things, the heavy documentation demands following from various safety standards. The purpose of this research proposal is therefore to investigate the possibilities for using agile methods to develop safety critical systems, with a focus on the analysis of safety hazards and specification of safety requirements.
